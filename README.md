# Air-Passengers-Forecast
Used Time Series analysis to forecast the number of passengers that are going to travel in the next 10 years based on the past number of travel records.
Used ARIMA model for training and tried several values of the p, q and d parameters using the pacf and acf plots to get the least error.
